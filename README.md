 A 3 tier MVC Web Application. The application will be used to manage users. The web application has  the ability to view all users, add a user, update a user, and delete a user. 

Ran into an error where the application will open but nothing is shown on the page. Failed the moment of truth. 

**UPDATE 
Fixed error of page not showing, view now shows the jsp but data not being pulled from db correctly
**

**UPDATE
FIXED view, jsp now successfully pulls data from db. Application works as intended which gives the user the ability to add, update, and delete user database entries.
